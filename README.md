# Social-Media-Startup
## Description
This application demonstrates the back-end mock representation of a social media startup. It includes the demonstration of mongoDB and the "M" and "C" of the "MVC" description of application format. 

## Installation
To Install this application, clone the repo in the folder of your choosing. Then, run 'npm install' in the terminal from the root folder of your project. Once you download all neccessary dependencies, run 'npm install' in the terminal and it should open up in port localhost:3200. Open Insomnia and test the routes and make sure they work well! If you have any issues with MongoDB not running on windows, be sure to go to administrative tools > services > MongoDB Server (MongoDB)... then right click and press start.
